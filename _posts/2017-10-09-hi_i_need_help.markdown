I am a diligent note taker which is great for referencing back to topics when I need help. However, there are times when I realize that I am so focused on taking notes that sometimes I am not retaining the information I am learning about. Building the entire Tic Tac Toe game was hard. I was able to copy and paste most of my past work, but then had to think comprehensively to put the game together based on what I have learned thus far. I worked through the code until I was at a mental block and then asked for help. 

The Learn community and Tech Coaches are always quick to respond, patient and passionate about helping me learn. In every job I have undertaken, I love asking for help. Moreso to see how other people tackle projects and issues so I can formulate that into my own solution. Hearing thought processes from different people helps me work through my own work process and spurs a more creative learning environment. It also creates a bonded community where everyone's input is respected and accepted.

Coding is hard and you have to want to do it. Asking for help and actively participating in the community of students who are learning with me is helping me stay motivated. I worked through Tic Tac Toe and eventually it passed all the local tests. I did this by asking for help, thinking comprehensively, taking breaks when I was overwhelmed and by remaining committed to solving the problem.
