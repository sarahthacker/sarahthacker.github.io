I only breathe when I'm drowning. It's just how I work. I love a challenge and the continued pursuit of learning. Programming is becoming more essential to businesses across all industries and I realized I needed more on my resume than my Bachelor's degree. Between working full time in Marketing and raising two kids, I stumbled upon Flatiron School. This was exactly what I needed to bolster my skills and give me flexibility and options in my career. 

Starting this program has been exciting, overwhelming and addicting. The lessons are communicated in humanized tone which balances the diffiiculty of learning programming. This has been a challenge to learn new concepts outside of my comfort zone, but the high level of support and community has reassued me that I am on the right track. 

I am only a few weeks into the program, so I am excited to see how the lessons and labs progress. By the end of this program, I hope to have a better understanding of programming and how I can contribute more to my current company or branch out to something new.
